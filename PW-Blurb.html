            <p><b>Blurb:</b> <br><i>We (Marcos, Pranav, and Ruhaan) created our own mythologies when we were aged nine, in Year 5E. In our mythologies, there were gods.<br> Like all other mythologies. We decided to make these gods more powerful than any other type of god, whether it was Indian, Greek, or Roman.<br> We called these gods ‘trods’.

                Trods were approximately 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 to the power of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 times more powerful than the most powerful Egyptian god to ever exist, Ra. And that was just the power of the weakest one, Hairtricus. Hairtricus is the trod of hair.</i></p>
